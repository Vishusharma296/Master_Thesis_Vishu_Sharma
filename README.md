Thesis Title: Design and Implementation of Wireless Sensor Network Using LoRaWAN, MQTT and Cloud Computing

Short Description: 

LoRaWAN based wireless networks solves two most important problems of the IoT applications: 
They provide very long range communication (2-15 Km) at very low power consumption rate.
LoraWAN based sensor nodes can run upto 10 years on AA sized batteries with very little maintenance.

MQTT is a light weight message transport protocol suitable for Machine to Machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).
It is has a publish/subscribe model for communication where clients can publish (publisher) and subscribe (subscribers) to the topics on which messages were published.
MQTT allows to establish secure connections with a large variety of devices even with unreliable network connections.

The research in this report mainly focuses on the use of LoRaWAN technology, MQTT protocol and use of cloud
servers as well as local servers in creating long range, low power wireless sensor networks.
The objective of the research work done during this master thesis was to create a small scale Wireless
Sensor Network (WSN) as a proof of concept. This WSN is the technical layer for an IoT platform. 
The application of this sensor network is mainly in smart cities, industrial automation and agriculture.
