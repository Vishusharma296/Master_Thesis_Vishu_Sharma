Thesis Title: Design and Implementation of Wireless Sensor Networks Using LoRaWAN, MQTT and Cloud Computing

Short Description: 

The main objective of research work done during this master thesis was to create small scale Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSN) as proof of concept. These WSNs are the technical layer for an IoT platform. 
The application of this sensor network is mainly in smart cities, industrial automation and smart agriculture.

LoRaWAN based wireless networks solves two most important problems of the IoT applications: 
They provide very long range communication (2-15 Km) at very low power consumption rate.
LoraWAN based sensor nodes can run upto 10 years on AA sized batteries with very little maintenance.

MQTT is a light weight message transport protocol suitable for Machine to Machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).
It uses a publish/subscribe model for communication. Clients can publish (publishing clients like sensors) on topics to a central broker (MQTT Server)
subscribing clients (say smart phone or PC) can subscribe to the topics of their interest to see the messages.
MQTT allows to establish secure connections with a large variety of devices even with unreliable network connections. 
MQTT is far more suitable for IoT application compared to REST based protocols like HTTP.

Cloud computing allows to build the scalable infrastructure without having too much technical expertise in database management.
It also allows to do data analytics and creating application servers for data consumption via dashboards.

The research in this report mainly focuses on the combined use of LoRaWAN technology, MQTT protocol and use of cloud
servers as well as local servers in creating long range, low power wireless sensor networks.
